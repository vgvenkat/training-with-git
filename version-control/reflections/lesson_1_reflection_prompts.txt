How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was an automated way of viewing differences between files. It makes finding differences easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Checking what issues were there before and how we have resolved them is really helpful.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    We can decide when and what is saved locally and also on the server, helps collaboration.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It helps in committing code for a feature as 1 commit. Modularization.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log, git log --stat give information on all commits done.
    git diff is used to compare two commits using their hashes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always rollback.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Commit content and keep track.
