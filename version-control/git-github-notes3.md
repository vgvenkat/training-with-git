#### Setup github remote repository
- remote repository is a hosted version of local repository.
- two ways of interaction is through git pull and push.
- `git remote` shows all remotes present
- `git remote add name` if there are jsut 1 remote, it is usually named origin.
- so `git remote add origin github_url`

- once remote is set, do `git push origin master` i.e. 2 branches where to push and what to push.
- in github.com, `commits` is similar to `git log`
